                    <h2>About the Band</h2>
                    <p>Bleed Horizon, formed back in 2003, is one of the most renowned nu-metal bands of the decade. With a punk, electric sound, they set themselves apart from the rest. Back in 2015, they took a significant hiatus as their leader Devon Schwartz had his first child and wanted to focus on his family. Years later, after all the members had settled into the groove of mundane family life, they reunited for a comeback. "Shattered Realms" was introduced, showcasing a new version of themselves and breaking from the mold they were once stuck in.</p>
